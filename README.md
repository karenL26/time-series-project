# Time Series Project
> 4 Geeks Academy - project by @karenL26 :elf:

In this project we will deal with time series forecasting by creating a cpu usage anomaly detection model. We are going to create two models, one using ARIMA and the other using Prophet.

In this project you can find some basic exploratory analysis and the data preparation for modeling [here](src/explore_tsf.ipynb).

The model construction is [here](src/app.py).

The datasets were obtained from the following links: 
* [cpu_train_a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oreilly-mlsec/book-resources/master/chapter3/datasets/cpu-utilization/cpu-train-a.csv)
* [cpu_train_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oreilly-mlsec/book-resources/master/chapter3/datasets/cpu-utilization/cpu-train-b.csv)
* [cpu_test_a](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oreilly-mlsec/book-resources/master/chapter3/datasets/cpu-utilization/cpu-test-a.csv)
* [cpu_test_b](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oreilly-mlsec/book-resources/master/chapter3/datasets/cpu-utilization/cpu-test-b.csv)
